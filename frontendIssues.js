//sign in form is not leading to mainpage -- fixed
//no logout button
//possible work on the posts,need to change the post model
//in the frontend code should be modulerized for better error handling and readability
/*update ui for posts to have an email ,or lets say name of the poster somewhere all the display "fake" posts
will have the name source*/
/*create a new mongodb collection hence new model,postRecords,to record postId and email of poster
this should use keys from the other identity and post collections */
//work on the payment method with mpesa faraja api or use aternative api if must

//so now that sign in form has been fixed ,the problem occurs where the formData from sign in doesn't g to the app.jsx
